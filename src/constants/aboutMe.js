  'I graduated from Seton Hall University with a Doctorate in \
  Physical Therapy after completing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology. \
  I have worked in the following settings: subacute care and outpatient/sports \
  orthopedics, where I have encountered patients encompassing a multitude \
  of physical and neurological presentations and limitations. Most of my \
  mentorship is based on combining manual therapy with an individual \
  exercise program to tailor to the specific functional needs and goals \
  of the patient.'

export const climbingLifeText = 'I am an avid rock climber based in the NJ/NY/PA \
  area. I first got into climbing in 2019 and quickly became obsessed with \
  the sport. My favorite part of climbing is definitely the problem solving \
  aspect of things, and the fact that people can have such wildly different \
  beta work for them, thus making climbing such an inclusive sport that \
  tailors to all types of body shapes and differing strengths.'

export const whyClimbingRehabText = 'I have seen and personally experienced \
  how the medical system bounces climbers from one "specialist" to another \
  without understanding our sport. I know firsthand how important climbing \
  can be and will apply the latest climbing-based research into my \
  treatment to get you back on the wall as soon as possible. This is my \
  passion project that started out as a humble Instagram page looking to \
  provide pro-bono information to the climbing community (and still do!). \
  Seriously, the thought of making this a viable source of income never \
  crossed my mind as I worked in a standard outpatient orthopedic clinic, \
  so thank you to everyone that has made this journey possible with your \
  encouraging words.'
